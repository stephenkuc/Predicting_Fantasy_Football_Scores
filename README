This is the readme file for this Fantasy Football project.

Utilizing data from past years, I want to predict the next year's fantasy results. As an avid player, I'm always wondering and thinking of ways to possibly improve my teams and strategies for each year.

It is my goal to create notebooks to easily be able to predict results for an upcoming season, as long as data is available for the previous 2.

Utilizing data from sources like Kaggle, web-scraping on football statistic sites like profootballreference.com, and the API nfl_data_py that connects with nflfastR, nfldata, dynastyprocess, and Draft Scout, I will create models to predict the next year's fantasy results.

This will begin smaller, using fantasy data and roster data, to predict results. However, I am eager to explore the impact of certain statistics, like team or teammate play, on a player's production both from an analytical and predective standpoint.

After plenty of cleaning, merging, and exploring the data, I've begun a Tableau Dashboard to easily visualize this data and begin to notice trends:

If anyone reading this has any ideas or worked on similar projects, I'd love to connect and collaborate!
